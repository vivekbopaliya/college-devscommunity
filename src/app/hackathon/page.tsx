              The registration phase marks the initial step for participants to
              express their interest in joining the hackathon. During this
              period, individuals or teams register for the event by providing
              necessary information, such as team details, participant names,
              and any required background information. Organizers often use
              online platforms or dedicated websites to streamline the
              registration process and gather essential data.

              Following successful registration, participants are typically
              required to prepare and submit their project proposals or
              presentation materials. This phase is crucial for teams to outline
              their project ideas, objectives, and any preliminary work they
              have done. Presentation submission allows organizers to review and
              assess the proposed projects, ensuring they align with the
              hackathon's theme and guidelines.

              the hackathon event. The acceptance notification phase involves
              notifying participants or teams about the outcome of the selection
              process. Successful participants receive confirmation of their
              acceptance into the hackathon, while those who are not selected
              may receive feedback or information on future opportunities.
